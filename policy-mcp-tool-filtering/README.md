# Filtering MCP Tools with Warden Policy

**Goal:** put an MCP server behind Warden and let a **policy** decide which of its tools an agent can
see and call — then watch the effect live in Claude. You'll ask Claude the same question twice, *"list
all the available tools on github mcp server"*, and change nothing but the policy: first Claude sees
GitHub's full tool set (including destructive writes), then only read-only tools, with writes refused
at the gateway.

We front **GitHub's hosted MCP server** with Warden. An agent authenticates to Warden with a JWT from
**Ory Hydra**; Warden injects a GitHub token per request (the agent never holds it) and enforces the
tool-filtering policy on every call.

| | Without the filter | With the filter |
|---|---|---|
| Tools Claude sees | every GitHub tool, incl. `delete_*`, `create_*`, `push_*` | only `get_*`, `list_*`, `search_*` |
| A `delete_repository` call | forwarded to GitHub | **refused at Warden**, never reaches GitHub |
| The GitHub token | injected by Warden, never on the agent | injected by Warden, never on the agent |

---

## The problem

Point an MCP client at a hosted server the usual way and it holds a long-lived token and can call
**every** tool that token's scopes allow — including destructive ones. A hallucinated or
prompt-injected `delete_repository` is just another tool call; nothing between the model and GitHub
decides whether it's allowed. You want a single place to say *"this agent may read, not write,"* that
holds regardless of what the model decides to do.

## The solution

Route the MCP server through Warden and attach a policy that decides which tools the agent may use.
Warden strict-parses every JSON-RPC call, **prunes `tools/list`** so the client only sees permitted
tools, and refuses any disallowed `tools/call` before it leaves the gateway.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **[Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)**
- A **GitHub Personal Access Token** (classic, scopes `repo` + `read:org`) — Warden verifies it when
  you create the credential, so it must be valid. You'll paste it into a single Warden command in
  Step 4. **Don't put it in an environment variable** — keeping it out of your shell environment is
  the whole point: no agent you launch from this shell (Claude included) ever sees it.
- The **Warden CLI + server** binary. This installs the latest release for your platform:
  ```bash
  curl -sL https://wardengateway.com/install | bash
  warden --version      # confirm it's on your PATH
  ```

Clone this repo and work from the tutorial folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stephnangue/warden-tuto.git
cd warden-tuto/policy-mcp-tool-filtering
```

### Step 1 — start the identity provider (Hydra)

```bash
docker compose up -d

# wait ~10s for Hydra to initialize and create the OAuth2 client, then confirm:
docker compose logs hydra-client-init | grep my-agent   # ->  [OK] my-agent
```

This runs Ory Hydra with an in-memory database and one pre-created client, `my-agent` /
`agent-secret`, that mints JWTs via the OAuth2 `client_credentials` grant.

### Step 2 — start Warden (dev mode)

In a **separate terminal**, run the Warden server in the foreground (dev mode: in-memory,
auto-unsealed, root token `root`):

```bash
warden server --dev --dev-root-token=root
```

Back in your first terminal, point the CLI at it:

```bash
export WARDEN_ADDR=http://127.0.0.1:8400
export WARDEN_TOKEN=root
warden status          # sealed: false
```

### Step 3 — trust Hydra's JWTs

Enable the JWT auth method and point it at Hydra via OIDC discovery. Warden runs on your host, so it
reaches Hydra at `localhost:4444` for both discovery and key fetching:

```bash
warden auth enable jwt
warden write auth/jwt/config \
  oidc_discovery_url=http://localhost:4444 \
  bound_issuer=http://localhost:4444
```

### Step 4 — front GitHub's MCP server

This has four small pieces; run them one at a time.

**1. Mount the generic `mcp` provider** at a path that identifies GitHub:

```bash
warden provider enable -path=github-mcp -description="GitHub Copilot MCP" mcp
```

**2. Point the mount at GitHub's MCP endpoint** and the JWT auth method:

```bash
warden write github-mcp/config \
  mcp_url=https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp \
  auto_auth_path=auth/jwt/ \
  timeout=10m \
  max_body_size=10485760
```

**3. Create the credential source** — the connection info for GitHub:

```bash
warden cred source create github-src -type=github -rotation-period=0 \
  -config=github_url=https://api.github.com
```

**4. Store your PAT as a credential spec.** Warden injects it upstream per request, so the agent never
holds it. Paste your token directly in place of `ghp_your_token_here` — **don't** put it in an
environment variable, or an agent you run from this shell (Claude included) would inherit it:

```bash
warden cred spec create github-ops -source github-src \
  -config auth_method=pat -config token=ghp_your_token_here
```

### Step 5 — start with NO filter (the "before")

Four small pieces; run them one at a time.

Two policies govern an MCP call, and they answer different questions. A **capability policy**
says which paths the caller may reach; an **MCP policy** says which calls are permitted once
it gets there. Access is the intersection, so both must be in scope.

**1. Write the capability policy** — this one never changes in this tutorial:

```bash
warden policy write mcp-access - <<'EOF'
path "github-mcp/role/+/gateway*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "delete"]
}
EOF
```

**2. Write a permissive MCP policy** — every method, every tool. This is the one we'll rewrite
in Step 7:

```bash
warden policy write -type mcp mcp-tools - <<'EOF'
path "github-mcp/role/+/gateway*" {
  methods { allowed = ["*"] }
  tools   { allowed = ["*"] }
}
EOF
```

A bare `*` is the wildcard that matches everything. Writing it out is deliberate: an MCP mount
with **no** MCP policy in scope denies every call, so "wide open" has to be stated rather than
left blank — which also keeps it visible in a policy listing and in the audit log.

**3. Create the role** that carries both policies and the GitHub credential:

```bash
warden write auth/jwt/role/mcp-user \
  token_policies=mcp-access,mcp-tools \
  user_claim=sub \
  cred_spec_name=github-ops \
  token_ttl=1h
```

**4. Turn on an audit log** so you can watch the decisions:

```bash
warden audit enable file -file-path=/tmp/warden-audit.log
```

### Step 6 — connect Claude and look at the tools

**1. Get a JWT from Hydra.** This is the agent's *own* identity credential — unlike the GitHub PAT,
it's meant for Claude to present, so exporting it is fine:

```bash
export JWT=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4444/oauth2/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=my-agent&client_secret=agent-secret&scope=api:read api:write" \
  | jq -r '.access_token')
```

**2. Register the mount with Claude Code.** The shell expands `$JWT` into the header, so the resolved
token is what gets stored:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http github \
  "http://127.0.0.1:8400/v1/github-mcp/role/mcp-user/gateway/" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $JWT"
```

**3. Confirm it connected:**

```bash
claude mcp list      # github: ✓ Connected
```

Now open a `claude` session and ask, in plain language:

> **list all the available tools on github mcp server**

Claude enumerates the **full** GitHub tool set — including write tools like `delete_repository`,
`create_or_update_file`, and `push_files`. Ask a read too ("list 3 of my repositories") and it works.

> **Don't ask Claude to run a destructive write here.** The point is only that those tools are exposed
> and callable — nothing at the gateway would stop a hallucinated or injected `delete_*`. That's what
> we fix next.

### Step 7 — apply the filter

Claude fetches an MCP server's tool list once, when a session starts, and caches it for the whole
session — so a running session won't notice a policy change. **Exit your `claude` session first**
(`/exit`), *then* rewrite the **same** MCP policy as an allow-list, plus an explicit deny-list for
good measure:

```bash
warden policy write -type mcp mcp-tools - <<'EOF'
path "github-mcp/role/+/gateway*" {
  methods {
    allowed = ["tools/list", "tools/call"]
  }

  tools {
    allowed = ["get_*", "list_*", "search_*"]
    denied  = ["delete_*", "create_*", "update_*", "push_*", "merge_*"]
  }
}
EOF
```

Note what you did **not** touch: `mcp-access` and the role are unchanged. The capability grant and
the tool contract are separate documents precisely so you can tighten what an agent may *do* without
restating what it may *reach*.

Each family block is **deny-by-default**: a tool must match `allowed` and must *not* match `denied`
(a deny always wins). Patterns are case-insensitive and use a trailing `*`. The MCP handshake methods
(`initialize`, `ping`, `server/discover`, `notifications/*`) are always exempt.

### Step 8 — ask the same question again (the "after")

**Start a fresh `claude` session** and ask exactly what you asked before:

> **list all the available tools on github mcp server**

The new session fetches the pruned list, so this time Claude shows **only** the `get_*` / `list_*` /
`search_*` read tools. The write tools are gone — Warden pruned them from `tools/list` under the new
policy. The identical prompt, a different answer, and the only thing that changed was the policy.

A read still works ("list 3 of my repositories"). Now ask for a write:

> **delete my repository `demo`**

This time Claude has no `delete_repository` tool to reach for — it was pruned from the list — so it
can't attempt the delete at all, and tells you it has no way to do it. The dangerous capability was
never offered to the model in the first place, so there's nothing to hallucinate or inject.

That pruning is trustworthy because it comes from the *same policy* the gateway enforces on every
request: even a forged call that skipped the tool list would be refused with `insufficient_permissions`
("Tool 'delete_repository' not allowed.") before anything reached GitHub.

### Step 9 — see it in the audit log

Every decision was recorded. Watch the two calls you just made:

```bash
tail -f /tmp/warden-audit.log | jq 'select(.type=="request") | {
  allowed:  .auth.policy_results.allowed,
  tool:     .auth.policy_results.mcp_decision.name,
  decision: .auth.policy_results.mcp_decision.decision,
  rule:     .auth.policy_results.mcp_decision.rule_type,
  matched:  .auth.policy_results.mcp_decision.matched_rule
}'
```

The blocked write shows:

```json
{ "allowed": false, "tool": "delete_repository", "decision": "deny",
  "rule": "denied_tools", "matched": "delete_*" }
```

The injected GitHub token never appears in the clear — the audit layer salts it to `hmac-sha256:…`.

## Troubleshooting

- **`claude mcp list` shows `github ✗`** — the JWT expired (1h TTL) or wasn't pasted literally. Mint a
  fresh one (Step 6) and `claude mcp remove github` then re-add. Quick connectivity check:
  ```bash
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X POST \
    "http://127.0.0.1:8400/v1/github-mcp/role/mcp-user/gateway/" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
    -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
  ```
- **`credential spec "github-ops" not found`** — Step 4's `cred spec create` failed (usually an
  invalid PAT — Warden verifies it on creation). Re-run that command with a valid token.
- **`404` from GitHub on a tool call** — trailing-slash mismatch. The gateway URL must end
  `…/gateway/`; the suffix after `gateway` is forwarded verbatim to GitHub's `…/mcp/`.
- **The tool list didn't change after Step 7** — Claude caches the tool list for the life of a
  session, so re-asking in the *same* session won't help. Exit Claude (`/exit`), then start a new
  `claude` session; it fetches the pruned list on connect.

## Cleanup

```bash
claude mcp remove github
# stop the `warden server --dev` process (Ctrl-C in its terminal)
docker compose down -v
rm -f /tmp/warden-audit.log
unset WARDEN_ADDR WARDEN_TOKEN JWT
```
